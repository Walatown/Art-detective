## 📱 App Flow

The app’s journey focuses on **simplicity and delight**:

1. **Welcome Screen** → Introduction or login.  
2. **Scanning Screen** → Point the camera at an artwork.  
3. **Result View** → Artwork details, fun facts, and animation overlays.

Each step was designed to maintain the visitor’s focus on the artwork, not the interface.


## 🤖 Integrations

### Google Vision API
Used for identifying artworks through image recognition.  
Provides labels, color palettes, and object detection with minimal setup.

### Rijksmuseum API
Provides artwork metadata — artist name, creation year, and descriptions.

### Privacy Considerations
- No user data is stored.
- Images are analyzed in real-time and immediately deleted.
- Scanning focuses only on artwork (context-aware detection planned).

🧩 Stack:
- Swift (iOS)
- Google Vision API
- Rijksmuseum API
- Adobe After Effects (animation overlays)
- Figma (UI/UX design)
